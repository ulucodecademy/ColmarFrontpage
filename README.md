This is the final project of the Codecademy course 'build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages. During this course there were 'work-in-the-browser' tasks to fullfill. 
This was too much guidance for me. During this project I wasn't yet introduced to Grid and was constantly confused about how to use flexbox. After finishing the project, I
rebuild it to get a better grasp of what I am really doing. It was a lot of fun to build this project, I am still a little bit confused about whether to use flexbox or Grid.
